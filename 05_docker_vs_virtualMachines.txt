🎯 Virtual Machine:
    A VM emulates an entire operating system inside a Hypervisor (like VMware, VirtualBox, or KVM).
    Each VM includes:
    👉A guest OS (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows)
    👉Virtualized hardware (CPU, RAM, storage)
    👉Runs independently from the host OS

    💡 Example VM Usage:
        👉 Running a different OS on your machine (e.g., running Linux on Windows).
        👉 Hosting multiple, fully isolated applications with different OS needs.

🎯 Docker:
    Docker shares the host OS kernel and isolates processes instead of running a full OS.
    Each container:
    👉Runs as a lightweight process
    👉Has its own filesystem, libraries, and dependencies
    👉Does not need a separate OS

    💡 Example Docker Usage:
        👉 Running microservices (small independent applications).
        👉 Deploying scalable applications in cloud environments.
        👉 Faster development and testing with isolated dependencies.
